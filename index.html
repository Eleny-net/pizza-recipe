        <strong id="Preparation">Step: 1 Preparation</strong>To make pizza you will need to have the ingredients ready. The minimum amount you should make is around 2Kg of dough.<br> Have 1 liter of lukewarm water in a bowl.<br> 
Weight 50 grams of salt and divide the yeast block in order to obtain a 3 grams piece.<br>
Have ready 1.8 Kg flour and leave aside 200g.(W-300).<br>
<br><strong id="Making-the-dough">Step 2: Making the dough</strong> To start, add the yeast to the water and mixing until fully dissolved. Leave it there for about 2 minutes. Add then spoon of flour and mix it well. Add another spoon and mix again. Repeat for about the amount of 10 spoons. Leave it resting for about 5 minutes Add now add, a bit at the time, the rest of the flour and reach about 1.8Kg.<br> You will reach the stage when the dough gets more consistent and therefore can be move of a table and worked. A wooden surface is better because of the stability of the temperature.<br>
The best way to work it is to fold it, press it down and turn it 90 degree every time. This is the traditional way to build up the gluten fibers. The process should last about 10 minutes.<br>
<br><strong id="First-leaven">Step 3: First leaven</strong> At this point, rest the dough for about 1 hour at room temperature. Keep the dough cover with a wet cloth.<br>
After 1 hour we will incorporate the salt into the dough. Simply add it as you would have add more flour. (Some recipe at this point will also add oil.) 
After adding the salt and have the dough mixed, rest it for another hour. The dough will leaven about twice its original size.<br>
<br><strong id="Second-leaven">Step 4: Second leaven</strong> At this point, two hours have passed and it is time for the second stage. Mix again the dough and divide it into 200 grams pieces (for a normal pizza) or 80 grams pieces (for a mini pizza). Each piece is like a little ball. Cover with a cloth and let them rest for anything between 6 to 20 hours. 
Less than 6 hours the pizza will not rise in the oven More than 20 hours it will taste acidic.<br>
<br><strong id="Preparing-the-pizza">Step 5: Preparing the pizza</strong> There is no real rule to flat the dough. In fact any shape will work. 
One rule of thumb is not to touch the dough too much. This really depends on individual skills. 
You can use a rolling pin and I have seen people using bottles... making pizza should be fun. 
Also do not make it too thick otherwise will never cook properly.<br>
<br><strong id="Adding-toppings">Step 6: Adding toppings</strong> Once the dough has been flattened down, add the tomato, mozzarella and all the toppings you wish.<br>
Tip: careful with fresh vegetables because the loose water and the dough will not cook and turn soggy. 
Tip: someone might have seen Nutella pizza. To make it you need to float the dough and in a glass have ready water and 4 spoon of sugar mixed. Brush the sugared water on the pizza with the fingers like the tomato sauce. Cook the pizza an let cool a little bit. Add then the Nutella (or Jam etc...)<br>
<br><strong id="Cooking">Step 7: Cooking</strong> The pizza should cook at the highest temperature available in the over. Usually a normal pizza will take about 5 to 8 minutes.<br>
<strong>I made too much dough!!! </strong> <br>
Do not worry. Dough can be freeze for up to 2 month.<br>
